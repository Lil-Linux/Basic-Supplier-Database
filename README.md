# Basic-Supplier-Database

As part of my Oracle Database class, this project was aimed at designing a basic supplier database.

The database needed to include functionality for:

- Creating and receving purchase orders.
- Querying purchase orders.
- Generating monthly reports
- Generating aging reports.
- Determining short shipments.
